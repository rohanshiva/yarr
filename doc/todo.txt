- new: show image inside content
- new: update the parser to use the first media content
       if the primary content is missing (youtube feeds)

- fix: scrollTo/scrollBy with smooth behavior instead of scrollTop

- ref: organize "server" package using KonMari method
  https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin : nice example of router api

- ref: drop goquery, switch to cascadia (or `x/net`)
- ref: `mmcdole/gofeed` has too many indirect deps, drop it

- ref: convert `.content` to `#content`
